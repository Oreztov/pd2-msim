msim_guide_page1: "Payday 2: The Management Simulator (MSIM) is a mod that aims to improve the economy of Payday 2.\nTo do this, you have Properties which you invest in and an exchange where you convert your currencies.\nValues are scaled, so no matter how rich you may be, you'll always find use for your money.\nThe next pages will go over how to play the mod.\nHave fun!\n\nCredits:\nMade by Oreztov\nWith help from Xeletron and Hoppip\nAdditional properties by TimeForSteve"
msim_guide_page2: "The gameplay revolves around the Properties and Exchange tabs.\nPurchase properties to improve both, and cash out in the exchange.\nYour actions are limited by your Purchasing Power (PP) - Every transaction (except selling) costs PP.\nThe precentage it costs depends on how big the transaction is, scaled.\nAfter using some of your PP, you can replenish it by playing any heist.\nEach time you finish a heist, MSIM refreshes:\nNew properties are available to buy, and your Purchasing Power Recovery Rate (PPRR) is added to your PP.\nBuy properties, exchange currencies and play heists."
msim_guide_page3: "Each time you finish a heist, 3 new properties become available for purchase.\nYou start out with zero properties, and must invest in some with your Spending Cash to begin.\nEach property has a minimum cost, and scales up to a certain precentage of your spending cash balance.\nThere is a limit to how many properties you can own at any time, which you can increase.\nEach property has a unique feature and feature value that makes the property worthwhile.\nFor example:\nDiscounts property costs by 5%.\nIncreases maximum amount of properties owned by 4\nImproves Offshore Funds to Spending Cash conversion rate by 10%\netc...\nIf you have no more room for properties, or want to make some money back, you may sell them.\nBe aware - The value of the property may change since you've first bought it."
msim_guide_page4: "The exchange tab has the most impact on the basegame's economy.\nIn the exchange, you can make multiple conversions of currencies:\nOffshore Funds -> Spending Cash\nSpending Cash -> Continental Coins\nSpending Cash -> Experience Points\nThe conversion rates start out miniscule for balance purposes.\nHowever, you can increase the conversion rates by investing in certain properties."
